## R Code to construct a plot to answer Question 5: 
## How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999â€“2008 in Baltimore City?
##
## According to the 2008 National Emissions Inventory, version 3 Technical Support Document 
## (http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/net/2008neiv3/2008_neiv3_tsd_draft.pdf), the EPA
## defines two categories of mobile emission sources: on-raod and non-road. The non-road sources
## include "lawn and garden equipment, construction equipment, engines used in recreational activities, 
## portable industrial, commercial, and agricultural engines."(p. 107) The on-road mobile sources consist of 
## four sectors, which "include emissions from motorized vehicles that are normally operated on 
## public roadways. This includes passenger cars, motorcycles, minivans, sport-utility vehicles, 
## light- duty trucks, heavy-duty trucks, and buses. The sectors include emissions from parking 
## areas as well as emissions while the vehicles are moving."(p. 113)
## Based on these definitions, we will consider motor vehicles to be mobile on-road emission sources.
##
## This script reads in the the National Emissions Inventory (NEI) data for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.
## It subsets the Balitmore City data, and then subsets the mobile on-road emission sources. It then
## uses ggplot to plot a time series of motir vehicle emissions for Baltimore City, 1999 - 2008.
##
## From the graph we can see that motor vehicles emissions declined slightly from 1999 to 2008, 
## although there was an increase from 1999 to 2005.
