## R Code to construct a plot to answer Question 4: 
## Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed 
## from 1999â€“2008?
##
## First we need to identify coal combustion-related sources. The 2008 National Emissions Inventory, 
## version 3 Technical Support Document (http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/net/2008neiv3/2008_neiv3_tsd_draft.pdf), the EPA
## describes the sectors the EPA uses to summarize emissions sources. The relevant sectors are Fuel Combusiotn 
## Commercial - Coal, Fuel Combustion Electric Generation - Coal, Fuel Combustion Industrial Boiler - Coal,
## and Fuel Combustion Residential - Other. The last sector includes liquid petroleum as well as coal, so
## we'll need to look at the SCCs to separate those out.
##
## To answer the question, we'll actually look at the trends of the different sectors, not just 
## the total emissions.
##
## This script reads in the the National Emissions Inventory (NEI) data for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.
## It subsets the coal combustion related sources using first the EI.Sector variable and then the 
## SCC Short Name variable to remove the liquid petroleum sources. It then uses ggplot to plot a time 
## series of emissions from coal combustion related sources separated by sector for 1999 - 2008.

### Finding coal combustion sources
###

# The EI.Sector for "Fuel Comb - Residential - Other" includes coal. To find out how to identify
# the coal sources first make a subset of the sector
otherSCC <- SCC$SCC[grepl("Fuel Comb - Residential - Other", SCC$EI.Sector)]
other <- NEI[NEI$SCC %in% otherSCC,]
otherFull <- join(other, SCC, by="SCC")

# Get all the short names corresponding to the SCC codes in the sector
x <- table(otherFull$Short.Name) > 0   # Create logical vector of the Short Names that are used
which(x == TRUE)  # Show the Short Names 

# There are three types, two of which are Coal sources:
#
# Stationary Fuel Comb /Residential /Anthracite Coal /Total: All Combustor Types 
# 9568 
# Stationary Fuel Comb /Residential /Bituminous/Subbituminous Coal /Total: All Combustor Types 
# 9570 
# Stationary Fuel Comb /Residential /Liquified Petroleum Gas /Total: All Combustor Types 
# 9574

### Answer
###
### From the graph we can see that commercial and residential sources declines slightly (almost level)
### and were low to begin with. Electric generation declines steeply. Industrial boiler increased,
### leveled, and then decreased, ending up slightly higher in 2008.
